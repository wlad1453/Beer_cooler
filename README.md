# Beer_cooler
A beer cooler for a sailing boat was created on the basis of Peltier elements. These elements cool the air within the container, 
the other surface of the elements has been cooled with the seawater. 
The critical question was that the Peltier elements works not long if they undergo very frequent switching.
In addition a special forecasting regulating algorithm was implemented.
